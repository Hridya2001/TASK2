# Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline  

This project showcases a fully automated data pipeline using the powers of AWS like **EventBridge**, **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **S3**, and **Snowflake**. It entails designing and implementing a real-time weather data pipeline to process and analyze the weather updates. The objective is to enable predictive insights for weather patterns.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  

### **Data Collection**  
- The **OpenWeather API** is used to collect real-time weather data, including:  
  - City name  
  - Temperature  
  - Weather  
  - Timestamp of the targeted location  

### **Event Scheduling**  
- **AWS EventBridge** is initiated to:  
  - Trigger the **Lambda function** hourly.  
  - Schedule the events for automation.  

### **Data Processing and Storage**  
- The raw weather data is processed through the **Lambda function**.  
- The processed data is stored in **DynamoDB**.  

### **Real-Time Tracking with DynamoDB Streams**  
- **DynamoDB Streams** track changes in the table.  
- When data is added, modified, or deleted:  
  - The **DynamoDB Stream** detects it.  
  - The **next Lambda function** is triggered to archive the modified data into an **S3 bucket**.  

### **Integration with Snowflake**  
- **Storage Integration** securely connects **S3** with **Snowflake** for seamless data transfer.  
- **Amazon S3** serves as an **external stage** for Snowflake.  
- For automatic and continuous ingestion of data from S3 to Snowflake tables:  
  - A **Snowpipe** is created.  
  - The **Snowpipe** is triggered by an **SQS queue**.  

### **Final Insights**  
- The pipeline calculates:  
  - **Average temperature** for each city.  
  - **Weather forecasts** for the targeted cities.
